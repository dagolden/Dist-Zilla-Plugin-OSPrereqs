=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::OSPrereqs - List prereqs conditional on operating system

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your dist.ini:

   [OSPrereqs / MSWin32]
   Win32API::File = 0.11

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Dist::Zilla> plugin allows you to specify OS-specific prerequisites.  You
must give the plugin a name corresponding to an operating system that would
appear in C<<< $^O >>>.  Any prerequisites listed will be conditionally added to
C<<< PREREQ_PM >>> in the Makefile.PL

=for Pod::Coverage setup_installer metadata

=head1 WARNING

This plugin works for Makefile.PL generated by the L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MakeMaker>
plugin or the Build.PL generated by the L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ModuleBuild> plugin,
and must appear in your dist.ini after whichever you use.

This plugin is a fairly gross hack, based on the technique used for
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::DualLife> and might break ifE<sol>when Dist::Zilla
changes how it generates install scripts.
